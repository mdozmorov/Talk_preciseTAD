## The 3D structure of the genome

- Human genome is big - ~3.2 billion base pairs
- ~4 meters (~12ft) of diploid genome is packed into ~10um nucleus
- ~800 trips from Earth to Sun in ~30T cells from the human body

.center[<img src="img/genome_scales.png" width = 600>]

<div style="font-size: small;"> 

Human body has approximately 30 trillion human cells (excluding trillions of microbiome cells); Stretched haploid genome would be roughly 2 meters - each cell has 4 meters of DNA (1 m = 3.28 ft); 30 trillion * 4 meters = 120 trillion meters; Convert to miles: 120 trillion meters / 1609.34 = 7.45*10^{10}; Convert to Earth-Sun distance: 7.45*10^{10} / 91.43*10^6 = 814.83

## Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops

- **TADs** – regions of increased chromatin interactions, separated by insulating boundaries
- **Loops** – points of enriched chromatin contacts, represented as high-intensity adjacent pixels on Hi-C maps
- Binding of CTCF and the members of cohesin complex (RAD21, SMC3) are a defining feature of domain boundaries

.center[<img src="img/tads_loops.png" width = 800>]

.small[Goloborodko et al. 2016 “Chromosome Compaction by Active Loop Extrusion.”]

---
## Pitfalls of existing TAD/loop callers

- Detect domains from Hi-C chromatin interaction matrices
- Heavily reliant on Hi-C data _resolution_ - the size of genomic regions used to bin the genome for measuring interaction frequency (1-100kb)
- Ignore the fundamental role of CTCF and other genome annotation data in domain formation

.center[<img src="img/tads_zoomin.png" width = 700>]

---
## Transcription factor enrichment at domain boundaries

- **Arrowhead** – an algorithm for finding contact domains
- **Peakachu** – a machine learning framework for chromatin loop detection
- **SpectralTAD** - Hierarchical TAD detection using spectral clustering
- **Grubert** – experimentally obtained cohesin-mediated loops (ENCODE III)

## Improving domain boundary detection using genome annotation data

- **Previous work:** using genome annotation data to predict enhancer-promoter interactions, genomic rearrangements (e.g., _3DPredictor_), Hi-C contact maps (e.g., _HiC-Reg_), and domain boundaries (e.g., _Lollipop_)

- **Limitations:** Operating at the resolution of Hi-C data, region size 1-100 kb

- **Hypothesis:** High-resolution genome annotation data can inform more precise location of domain boundaries

**preciseTAD** – learning boundary-transcription factor associations at the Hi-C resolution, transferring the learned associations at the base-pair resolution (predict the probability of each base being a boundary, cluster with DBSCAN, PAM)

Distance between boundary-annotation, random undersampling, 5kb resolution Hi-C data perform best

## preciseTAD definitions

- Trained on either _Arrowhead_ or _Peakachu_ detected boundaries

- Genome annotation data from ENCODE (Transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, chromatin segmentation data)

- preciseTAD detects 
    - **PTBRs**, _preciseTAD Boundary Regions_, regions enriched in bases with high boundary probability, DBSCAN
    - **PTBPs**, _preciseTAD Boundary Points_, most likely boundary summit points, PAM

## Summary

- Current TAD/loop callers focus more on visual Hi-C data characteristics and less on the underlying biology

- preciseTAD learns boundary-genomic annotation associations at the Hi-C data resolution and transfers this knowledge to the base-pair level

- Binding of four transcription factors (CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, ZNF143) is sufficient to improve domain boundary detection

- Models trained in one cell type can accurately predict boundaries in another cell type without Hi-C data
    - We predicted boundaries for 60 cell lines, imputing missing genomic annotations with Avocado (ongoing)

## Interpretation of differentially interacting chromatin regions (DIRs)

- **Visualization of DIRs.** A Manhattan-like plot of DIRs may inform us about abnormalities or reveal chromosome site-specific enrichment of differentially interacting regions

.center[<img src="img/manhattan.png" height = 350>]


## Interpretation of differentially interacting chromatin regions (DIRs)

- **Overlap between differentially expressed genes and DIRs.** If gene expression measurements are available, differentially expressed genes may be tested for overlap with DIRs - test the link between DIRs and changed gene expression

- **Functional enrichment of genes overlapping DIRs.** DIRs may disrupt specific pathways/functions - test whether genes overlapping DIRs are enriched in a canonical pathway or share a common function


## Interpretation of differentially interacting chromatin regions (DIRs)

- **Overlap enrichment between TAD boundaries and DIRs.** DIRs may correspond to TAD boundaries that are deleted or created - test DIRs for significant overlap with TAD boundaries detected in either condition or only in boundaries changed between the conditions

- **Overlap between DIRs and transcription factor binding sites.** DIRs may correspond to the locations where proteins bind to DNA, such as CTCF sites - test for enrichment of DIRs in any genome annotation (epigenomic mark)
